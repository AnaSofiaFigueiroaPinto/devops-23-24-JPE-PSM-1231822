To properly complete the first version of the part1 of this Class Assignment:
1. Created a dockerfile that provides all the correct instructions to build the image.
2. Then used the following command on the bash terminal: docker build -t ca4-part1 . (actually used the . )
With this command, successfully made a docker build of the image, so if I check the docker desktop app, in the section "images" I can see the image ca4-part1.
3. After that I ran the following command: docker run -p 59001:59001 ca4-part1. With this command, I was able to run the image, leading to an automatic creation of a container, which I can see in the docker desktop app, in the section "containers".
4. With the image running, in the git bash terminal I see that "The chat server is running..." and if I open a different git bash terminal, place myself on the `Ana Sofia@Ana-Sofia MINGW64 ~/Desktop/devops-23-24-JPE-PSM-1231822/CA2/Part1/gradle_basic_demo` directory, and then use the command: ./gradlew runClient, I can see that the chat application is working properly, since it opens the java window that allows me to chat with the server.
