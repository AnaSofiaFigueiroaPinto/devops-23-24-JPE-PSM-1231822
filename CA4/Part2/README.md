para esta part 2 - criei dois dockerfiles, um para db e outro para web e juntei um docker-compose.yml de forma a correr ambos os dockerfiles em simult√¢neo.

para criar a imagem do docker - utilizei o comando docker-compose up and both images were created as well as the containers and the app was running.

when writing localhot:8080 on the browser, the app was running and the database was connected to the app.
